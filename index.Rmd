# Introduction

This repository contains two training documents for the OCA Data Sharing Platform:

- [Chapter 2: Data dictionaries](#data-dict) covers the production of data dictionaries
to accompany datasets that will be shared

- [Chapter 3: Pseudonymization](#pseudonym) covers techniques for assessing and limiting disclosure risk
when preparing datasets to be share
